          <h4>Virtual Photo Walks</h4>

          <p>Within this project I was able to work with a randomized team of individuals within my class to somehow create a solution for this project.  The use of planning, communication, and persistence were huge factors that led to our success.  Being able to communicate easily to one another really helped this project run smoothly especially since this project was accomplished during a time where a heavy load of work was usually given within the semester.
          My group consisted of 6 team members including myself.  We designed a way that we would be able to give Virtual Tours to the elderly at The Heritage Lowman without having anyone leave their room.  For more information on the Heritage <a href="http://www.theheritageatlowman.org/about-us/">Click Here</a>.  We had two onsite teams, one at the Horse Shoe and the other team at the River.  At each location we had a cameraman and also a director.  At Heritage we had our headquarters where two individuals guided our attendees and also set up the projector to see our two teams at the locations.  Each tour lasted about 45 minutes and we had such a great outcome with participation from the individuals from Heritage.  After the tour they were sharing their own past times from these locations and they really appreciated us doing this for them.

           <h4>Create IT Discovery Day</h4>
<img src="http://i1086.photobucket.com/albums/j459/xSLPRx/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-20%20at%208.43.40%20PM.png" alt="Create IT Discovery Day" align="right">
          <p>My group of 3 along with 3 stakeholders invited students and faculty from the University of South Carolina that lead hands-on activities exploring the wide range of career options available in IT and the necessary skill sets required for success in those careers. The attendees were high school students ranging from grade 9-11th.  During Create IT Discovery day we even had parents that participated in the activities as well.  We set up 3 labs and also organized a campus tour.  The 3 labs included a Raspberry Pi Lab, Scratch Lab, and also a Circuit Basics lab.</p>
          <p>I was in charge of designing the labs and also finding volunteers.  There was a moment where I got close to traveling for 2 hours just to receive hardware I needed for a lab just so that I wouldn't have to play the waiting game for them.  Finding volunteers was harder than planned.  Most people in my classes were either working on their own projects or just didn't have time.  That's when I figured I would think outside the box and reach out to not only people in my class, but also people interested in learning about IT.  Once I expanded my search, I found all the volunteers I needed within 2 days.  I also created a Facebook page specifically for communication amongst my volunteers.  After the event was over, I purchased pizza out of my own expense just for thanking them for their cooperation.  That was something I did not inform my volunteers of in the beginning.
