          <h4>About Me</h4>

          <p>My time at the University of South Carolina has opened so many great opportunities to me.  When first being accepted into the University of South Carolina, I originally started as a Media Arts major and had a majority of my classes within McMaster College.  I met many great and talented people that have taught me so many great tools and skills that I would be able to use with my future.  However, after speaking to Disney's chairman for Graphic Design, it was then that I realized that Media Arts was not what I really wanted to get into for my main focus.  After taking a variety of different classes, which went from Journalism all the way to Criminal Justice, the sense of business has always grabbed my attention.  I then pursued to complete the requirements for a Marketing Degree.  Well, again I came across an issue, the position that I was in would force me to take 40 credit hours at a 4.0.  The catch is that they would all have to be electives since I already completed all the business classes I could as a Media Arts Major without being in the business school.  I didn't have anymore time to waste so I crunched down facts and looked back deep into my life into things that I loved doing.</p>

          <p>It was that moment that I put the two majors into perspective; Information Technology and Hospitality.  Hospitality seemed like an awesome major especially since I saw some of the internships within Casinos in Vegas.  That really grabbed my attention since I've always wanted to go there and I love that fast paced atmosphere that would come from that.  I didn't have too much of an idea of what Information Technology meant.  I ended up walking over to the McCutchin House to speak with Collin Crick (Director of Recruitment for the College of Hospitality, Retail and Sports Management) to get some more information on these majors.  He told me that students engaged in the hospitality major always have a great time and it's definitely a fun major to get into, but with IT, if you don't know too much about computers and coding it's probably not the major you want to get into because you will have a tough time.
          <p>

          <p>I gave everything that we talked over a thought for about two nights researching and looking into the fields of both majors.  I then quickly realized that I have been doing IT all of my life without even realizing it.  Information Technology also encompasses everything I have a passion for whether it's business, technology, customer support, or even creating things.  I felt like the light bulb in the head finally turned on and this is what I was made to do.  Not to mention all of the different places you can work within IT.  It's not to questions where you can work, but honestly where wouldn't you be able to work within IT.  This is where the future is going towards and I am always going to stay competitive with my skills.<p>
