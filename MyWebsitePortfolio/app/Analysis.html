          <h4>VC3 Internship</h4>

          <p>I cannot express how grateful I am to have the opportunity to work for such a great and tight-knit company.  VC3 is the first IT job I have had.  It has given me the possibility to test the skills I acquired from the University of South Carolina.  I was under the impression that IT was simply the knowledge of technology, software, and computers, however, I was greatly mistaken.  There are a lot more components involved than just the usual IT standards.<img src="http://i1086.photobucket.com/albums/j459/xSLPRx/Screen%20Shot%202015-07-20%20at%208.44.25%20PM_1.png" align="left">  My soft skills and communication skills were put to the test while helping customers troubleshoot and fix their technical problems.  I learned that I needed to combine my experience working within retail to that of IT.  This way not only do I resolve technical issues, but also determine the thought process I have when troubleshooting.  You would be surprised with some of the calls that I take from a day-to-day basis that includes a numerous variety of personalities, but honestly we are all humans.  Situations can take a much longer to fix when you identify the reason of a monitor not turning on is because it's not plugged in, whereas, usually, it's a hardware related problem. Immediately afterward, you have another user calling in because they cannot access their email.  Little do they know, their server is actually down, which is causing their inaccessibility, and then suddenly 5 seconds later, the phones start blowing up with multiple users having the same problem.  I am so thankful to witness this and be surrounded by such helpful and intelligent people.  From the start of my internship, I have always been offered help if needed, or even been offered to be shown solutions that I could not solve myself. </p>

          <p>VC3 not only prepares you for the future but also prepares you to face the real world.  Within my internship I learned that hard work doesn't always have to been seen within a suit and tie; the environment that I work in is so relaxed that it makes the hard thinkers think even harder because they are comfortable at work.  I have worked in both uniform and now casual attire workforces and just by comparing the two; the casual workforce is a lot more relaxed and happier than the uniform workplace.  I also saw an increase in voicing opinions, people feel more comfortable at VC3, which is why it is easy to see that this company has been rated one of the best places to work in the state South Carolina numerous times in a row.</p>

 

          <p>My first project consisted of myself setting up my own working station, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  My third day on the job, I ended up getting a blue "screen of death" BSOD.  My OS ended up getting corrupt and I could not boot up at all.  I attempted to boot from "safe mode" but still no luck.  I ended up using a co-workers USB drive that had Ubuntu on it to boot into, when I finally got in I had another co-worker let me use a nifty device called a Zalman.  This was the first time I ever used a Zalman and I must say this little device was amazing, he had over 5 different OS's on it and it basically tricks the computer into thinking you have the OS disc via USB.  So then I ended up installing windows back onto my computer while in Ubuntu and once that was done I began downloading all the programs I needed to complete my work.  This was a huge learning experience for me seeing how even at the slightest moment, things can go wrong fast but reaching out to your surroundings can always make things easier.

 

          <p>Another project that I helped work on was coding switches to prepare them for a Go-Live project. <img src="http://i1086.photobucket.com/albums/j459/xSLPRx/switch.jpg" alt="Switches I worked on for my internship" height="220" width="300" align="right">  A recently acquired customer site needed switches in their Go-Live and most of the engineers were really busy.   I offered to help out and learned how to code the switches.  I then entered code within the switches and prepped them so that all the engineer had to do was install them and easily plug them in.  It really took a lot of time out of the whole process and helped make things flow more smoothly. </p>
